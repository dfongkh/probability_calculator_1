# probability_calculator_1

This application determines the approximate probability of drawing certain balls randomly from a hat.

Suppose there is a hat containing 6 black balls, 4 red balls, and 3 green balls. 
What is the probability that a random draw of 3 balls will contain at least 2 red balls and 1 green ball? 

Rather then using mathematics to determine the result, I have created this application. 

To run the application, use main.py to run.
