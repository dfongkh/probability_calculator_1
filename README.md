# probability_calculator_1

For this project, you will write a program to determine the approximate probability of drawing certain balls randomly from a hat.

Suppose there is a hat containing 6 black balls, 4 red balls, and 3 green balls. 
What is the probability that a random draw of 3 balls will contain at least 2 red balls and 1 green ball?
